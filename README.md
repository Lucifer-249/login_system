# login_system
Hello Everyone ! Myself Mohit Thakral and i have created a User Management API with Email-ID verification using Node.js and HTML. It is basically a 
login system for any user so I'm naming it as login_system.

I've installed and used various dependencies for creating this project.These are the following:
1. bcrypt - It is used for safe storing of passwords in the backend of applications.
2. body-parser - It is used to use POST and PUT requests and it can parse JSON,urlencoded and multipart/form-data requests.
3. ejs - It used to generate dynamic HTML content by embedding JavaScript code within your HTML templates.
4. express - It is used to store important metadata about your Node.js project.
5. mongodb - MongoDB is a database which is used to store and managing structured and unstructured data.
6. mongoose - Mongoose is a MongoDB Object Data Modelling(ODM) library for the Node.js , it manages the relationship between data ,
              provides schema validation.
7. multer - It is used for processing and managing file uploads.
8. nodemailer - It is used for verification of the Email-ID.

All these 8 dependencies are used in this project and it can also be seen the package.json file in my project.

This project will work on port:3000
and server: http://127.0.0.1:3000/register
RUn this after calling (node index.js) in the terminal.
